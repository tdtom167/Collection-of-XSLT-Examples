        <title>My assignment</title>
        <para>I was assigned to create two web pages with XSLT examples:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>Construction of elements using literal elements</listitem>
            <listitem>Processing mode</listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
        <title>Construction of elements using literal elements</title>
        <para>
            I created a web page which defines what literal element is and how it is copied to the output.
            Then I showed an example with two input files (XML file and XSLT file) and displayed output and processor output.
        </para>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
        <title>Processing mode</title>
        <para>
            I created a web page about processing mode. I included detailed definition of operations of XSLT processor.
            I also focused on <code>&lt;xsl:processing-instruction&gt;</code> element which I defined and showed syntax and its
            attributes. Then I showed an example with XSLT code and the tag it creates.
        </para>
    </chapter>
    <chapter>
        <title>Try button update</title>
        <para>
            Finally I updated all pages in the project with "Try it yourself" button so that XSLT Live processor can be used
            as a help to understand the transformation and all examples mentioned.
        </para>

        <title>What did I work on?</title>
        <para>My task was to create three jsp sites with examples of transformations.</para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>XSLT &lt;if&gt;</listitem>
            <listitem>XSLT &lt;for-each&gt;</listitem>
            <listitem>XSLT &lt;value-of&gt;</listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>I also created the floating navbar with all of the subdomains of our web-app. It changes colors of
            currently open site in the navbar. There were some problems with the alignment but in the end everything
            works perfectly.</para>
        <para>I designed the example pages, transformation page and created stylesheet for the whole web-app. It contains
            mainly styling of the tables, horizontal lines, highlighting of the code in the text and boxes for displaying the code.</para>
        <para>Last, but not least I helped with redirecting of the pages.</para>
